// are still on the board, and endgame where only kings and pawns are
// left. There's a gliding transition between them, depending on how
// many of each piece type are left, represented by a phase value
// ranging from 256 (midgame) to 0 (endgame). This allows features to
// vary in importance depending on the situation on the board. Each
// feature is given two values, one for each phase. These are stored
// as a single integer and handled using the defines below.
